## Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example

If you are having a problem with some code and seeking help, preparing a Short, Self Contained, Correct Example (SSCCE) is very useful. But what is an SSCCE?

It is all in the name, really. Take a look at each part. The version prepared for others to see should be:

Short (Small) - Minimise bandwidth for the example, do not bore the audience.
Self Contained - Ensure everything is included, ready to go.
Correct - Copy, paste, (compile,) see is the aim.
Example - Displays the problem we are trying to solve.
